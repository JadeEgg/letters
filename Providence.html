    <h2>Providence.</h2>
     <p>How many times have I felt confused, frustrated, dejected, and lost after failing to get what I wantedâ€”something important? And every time, has it not been revealed to me that a guiding hand was opening the way?</p>
     <p>Despite learning to be aggressive in setting the pace of my games and doing whatever is necessary to attain results, I should remember this. Luck, destiny, fate... this led me to wisdom, though the universe is not perfectly kind to anyone.</p>
     <p>There is a plan: live in accordance with nature. Remember this during the difficulties that are to come.</p>
